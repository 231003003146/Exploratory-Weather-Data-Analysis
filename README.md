# Weather Data Analysis 🌦️📊

## Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a weather dataset to identify patterns and relationships between different weather conditions and numerical features.

## Objectives
- Analyze weather conditions such as Clear, Snow, Fog, etc.
- Filter and extract specific weather instances
- Compute mean values of numerical columns by weather condition
- Apply conditional filtering using logical operators

## Analyses Performed

## Analyses Performed

This project includes **15+ exploratory analyses** on weather data, covering:

- Filtering specific weather conditions (Clear, Snow, Fog, etc.)
- Conditional filtering using logical operators (AND / OR)
- Instance-based queries on weather attributes
- Mean value analysis grouped by weather condition
- Numerical and categorical data exploration
- Weather pattern extraction using Pandas
- Practical EDA questions commonly asked in interviews

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
